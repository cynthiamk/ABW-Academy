## Using Proxy Means Testing scores to determine vulnerable households at a risk of realizing universal health coverage in select counties, Kenya

******* TO BE FILLED BEFORE November 04, 2022 ***********

#### Background information
Kenya is currently operating in devolved function where the County governemts as they are often referred according to the Kenya Adminstrative levels are responsible for the wellbeing of their populations. With the current economic frustuations, weak health systems and national disasters such as the climate change amongst others, the already poor and marginalized households are being pushed to extreme poverty levels. The current situation is dire, and has the posibility of being worsened by the current climate change manace that is disrupting all walks of life presenting a dificcult situtation where county governments to do have transparent and gender lens systems to ensure that targetting of the poor is streamlined. Amref Health Innovations (AHI)  has participated in such programs before where households proxies were collected and used for identifying the needy households for social programs, however this has never been automated to serve other areas of interest such as the use of Proxy Means Testing scores to realize the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) for the marginalised populations. Therefore, using a proxy means test, which is basically an index of observable and verifiable household characteristics that serves as a proxy for housheold welfare there is a need to need to streamline the identification of the marginalised populations in our societies. This solutions will adopt python programming langauge for the creation of a poverty prediction model and use of Business intelligence systems to demonstrate and estimate the risk poor households have to accessing health care services as recommended in our policies where every household must be within 5 km radius to access health services. In so doing, we have influenced policies and directives that will enable proper planning on where to locate health facilities while also putting the interest of the poor and marginalised households at heart. 

#### Goal of the project
The Goal of this project is to streamline and automate the prediction of households at risk of poverty. In addition, the project will also provide a linkage as to how we can use technology and other external sources of data to ensure there is equality in the distribution and strengthening of health systems. 

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
The solution will target the county government leadership, non-governmental organizations and the departments of social protections to allow them make informed decisions when implementing safety net programes.
