## German Red Cross Global Operation Dashboard

#### Background information

With 192 national societies the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is the largest humanitarian organisation in the world. The German Red Cross (GRC) is part of this global community, having provided comprehensive aid for more than 150 years for people in conflict situations, disasters and health or social emergency situations, solely based on their level of need.

Under the banner of humanity, we campaign for life, health, welfare, protection, peaceful coexistence and the dignity of all human beings. Our idea is borne worldwide by over 100 million volunteers and members. Approximately four million members are active in Germany alone. The GRC, in its capacity as the National Red Cross Society and the umbrella organisation of the free welfare care system, is committed to the seven principles of the Red Cross:
- humanity,
- impartiality,
- neutrality,
- independence,
- the voluntary basis,
- unity and universality.

Areas of work:
In its capacity as the National Society and humanitarian organisation, the GRC observes extensive national tasks. These include the following:

- rescue services and first aid,
- health services, including a blood donation service,
- aid for the elderly, including care and a visiting service,
- aid for children, young people and families
- a tracing service and
- the Youth Red Cross.

The GRC is also operational worldwide in the field of humanitarian aid - both in acute emergency situations (disaster relief) and in long-term development cooperation projects. The GRC is currently working in about 50 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. The aid projects abroad are focused on:

- disaster relief and disaster reduction,
- the supply of drinking water,
- basic health,
- fighting epidemics, including HIV/Aids and Ebola,
- fighting poverty,
- rehabilitation and reconstruction.

The German Red Cross has a federal structure. It consists of the federal organisation (GRC National Headquarters) and its member societies (19 state societies and the nursing association) and their respective member societies (almost 500 branch societies, 32 nursing associations and more than 4.500 local societies).

#### Goal of the project

As the Information Management and Digitalisation lead for GRC Global Operation, I would like to create a dashboard that provides summaries, insights, and actionable information for management and colleagues that would help them better take evidence-based informed decisions.


#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
GRC Upper Management, Units Leads, Country Managers, and IM Team for
Viewing, monitoring, planning, evaluating, and implementing the needed actions for GRC Global Operation.


Identify atleast 2 collaborators from your organization who will support you by providing
- Isabelle Asfahani, GRC Disaster Risk Reduction Unit Lead, a collaborator.
- Marlene Fiedler, GRC Global Project ll Coordinator, a collaborator.

#### Expected Deliverables
For GRC global operations a dashboard including the following information will be deployed - total number of projects, countries, thematic areas, sectors, people reached.

#### Mentors (This will be added by ABW Team)
