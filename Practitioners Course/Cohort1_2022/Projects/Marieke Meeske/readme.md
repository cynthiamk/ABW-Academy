## Sentiment around Oxfam Novib Brand

#### Background information
Oxfam Novib recently (2021) adopted a new brand identity, with overall narrative around equality. As part of the Oxfam Confederation, a global movement of people who are fighting inequality, we work with partner organizations across the globe to co-create a world that is fair, safe, equal and sustainable for everyone. Together we fight for equal rights for every person, no matter their gender, identity, ethnicity or skin color. 
In standing for equality, Oxfam Novib is increasingly becoming an influencing organisation, combining policy advocacy with public campaigning. This means our activities are increasingly exploiting the potential of (social) media. In this project, I aim to make use of the public available data created in media, specifically around our new brand identity.

#### Goal of the project
The objective of this project is to “listen” to how Oxfam Novib brand is perceived. Specifically, I will dive into news articles (using https://www.gdeltproject.org/) and employ text mining techniques to 1) categorize and analyze the subject of conversation; and more importantly to 2) analyze the sentiment around Oxfam Novib brand. 
Secondly, if time allows, I also like to look into sentiment analysis for Facebook data. However this likely needs to become a second project.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
As part of the ‘Engagement Research project’, I am working closely together with the Engagement unit on several research streams, of which brand research is one. This project will complement this regular (benchmarked) survey research around our brand. Specifically, it will inform the evaluation of the new brand campaign.

Collaborators:
-	Francisco Bolaños, Impact Measurement & Knowledge Specialist, Learning Innovation & Knowledge unit (he is my research peer in the Engagement Research project)
-	TBD; colleague from the Brand & Digital team within Engagement Unit (this colleague is working on the implementation of the new brand identity and hence will co-create the focus of this project to what is most relevant for the Brand & Digital team)

#### Expected Deliverables
A PowerPoint presentation with key pointers around how Oxfam Novib is visible in media, and sentiment around our new brand identity, as input for the brand campaign evaluation.
