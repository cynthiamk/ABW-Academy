## Project Title

Identifying suitable locations for borehole sampling in West Darfur, Sudan

#### Background information

In West Darfur, many challenges arise in the provision of drinking water for household consumption. The dry season is characterized by droughts and shortages of water, whereas the relatively short wet season leads sometimes to flooding while even most of the rainwater is lost due to evaporation. For the Chronic Crisis West Darfur project, the Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS) together with the Netherlands Red Cross are working on increasing access to water facilities. The data team 510 will support the project with doing a site suitability analysis for new water sources, taking into account flood risk.

#### Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to identify the areas in three localities in West Darfur State in Sudan that are most suitable for borehole sampling, taking into account the presence of population, and vulnerability characteristics that can affect future boreholes. 

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

The NLRC project team as well as the SRCS staff in West Darfur State will use the results of this analysis to understand which locations to prioritize when sampling in preparation for additional borehole drilling in the remainder of the Chronic Crisis project as well as the next iteration of this project.
