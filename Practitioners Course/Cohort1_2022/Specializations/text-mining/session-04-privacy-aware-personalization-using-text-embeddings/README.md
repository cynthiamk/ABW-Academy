# Privacy-aware Personalization using Text Embeddings

Abstract: In this session we will introduce key approaches for personalization and will have a deep dive on text document recommendations, which is key in many use cases such as news recommendation and content discovery on the web. We will focus on specific personalization approaches that preserve user privacy, that is, algorithms that do not require any personal identifiable information.
